I'm currently a Special Adviser on AI and Data Protection to EC Justice Commissioner Reynders and a Parliament-appointed expert to the Belgian Data Protection Agency. In 2018-2019, I was a Special Adviser to EC Commissioner Vestager for who I co-authored the Competition policy for the digital era report. I'm affiliated with the Data Science Institute and Department of Computing. I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard working with Latanya Sweeney and Gary King and I received my PhD from MIT under the supervision of Alex "Sandy" Pentland (250-words bio).”
